# Playing Cards Draw Order – Part 2

[https://www.codewars.com/kata/6311b2ce73f648002577f04a]

This is Part 2 of this series of two katas — Part 1 is here.
If you like playing cards, have also a look at Hide a message in a deck of playing cards and Card-Chameleon, a Cipher with Playing cards.
In Part 1 of this series, we were given a deck and we had to return the order of the cards once drawn using a particular procedure.

Here, we will do the opposite: we will be given the drawn cards, and we'll have to return the deck that would produce this result if drawn using the procedure.

The procedure isn't explained here again, please read it on Part 1.

Your task
Write a function accepting a list of cards as argument, and returning the deck that would produce this list of cards if drawn using the procedure.

export const prepareDeck = (result: string[]): string[] => {
Cards are represented in the same way than in Part 1; the same preloaded function is available to print cards on the console.

Example
const result = ["KC", "QC", "KD", "QD", "KH", "QH", "KS", "QS"];

prepareDeck(deck);
should return:

["KC", "KH", "QC", "KS", "KD", "QH", "QD", "QS"];
Have fun!
I hope you will enjoy this kata! Feedbacks and translations are very welcome.
